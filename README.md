# Weather Dashboard

## About the Project

For this assignment we were asked to meet the following criteria:

    GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
    WHEN I search for a city
    THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

    WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

    WHEN I view the UV index
    THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

    WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

    WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

    WHEN I open the weather dashboard
    THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
